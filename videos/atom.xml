&lt;p&gt;In this test case, the numerical solution of a sessile drop is compared to the exact solution given by a set of ordinary equations for a 3D axisymmetric drop, both compared during the last 2 seconds of this animation. The test consists in releasing a drop and, due to gravitational force, the drop approaches the wall. I
mmediately before adhering the wall, the drop assumes a steady shape, which can be compared to the exact solution. The interface between the fluids is represented by a triangular surface mesh and the 3D domain by a tetrahedron mesh. The animation is colored by the pressure&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;3-dimensional vortex field test case. This particular benchmark tests extensively the remeshing methodology implemented in our &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt; code. The test consists in applying a 3d vortex field on a sphere which will be complete distorted in t=0.5T, where T is the total time of the simulation. From t=0.5T to t=T, the vortex fie
ld is reverted and the original sphere shape is thus expected. The characteristic mesh length is L=1/50. The literature shows equivalent result using a different approach for mesh length L=1/256, which proves that the proposed remshing method is&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;In this test case, the remeshing methodology is massively tested while the bubble is subjected to a single vortex field. The tetrahedral background mesh is colored by the magnitude of the vortex field velocity. The red color represents high velocity, while the blue one stands for low intensity. As can be seen, the volu
me and interface remeshing algorihtms keep the finite elements with excellent aspect ratio (height, width, area and volume), thus avoiding low quality elements such as silver and kite types. Additionally, the phase volumes are kept constant, showing that the used methodology is suitable for large&amp;nbsp;deformations.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;The Zalesak&amp;#8217;s test case is a common benchmark to evaluate the reconstruction of the interface while the Zalesak sphere is rotating. The background flow is imposed with no need of solving the Navier-Stokes equations. As can be seen in the animation and despite the coarse mesh used on this test case, our moving mesh meth
odology keeps the interface sharp and with minimal numerical diffusion after many rotations. The red color represents the sharp interface (triangular surface) and the blue stands for the outer mesh (tetrahedrons). The green color is due to the interpolation of the rendering program&amp;nbsp;Paraview.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Modeling of last stage of two bubble&amp;#8217;s coalescence process. The animation shows three different views of the same simulation to illustrate the approaching of two bubbles. Using the 3D &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ALE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;FEM&lt;/span&gt; code, we are able to study the physical phenomena that takes place before the unexplored and non-trivial process of bubble coale&amp;nbsp;scence.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Two-phase flow of a single bubble in a triangular channel. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized through the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework in which the interface between fluids are accessed sharply by defining a triangular surface embed on the tetrahedral mesh. In such a particular simulation, the confi
ned bubble is deformed due to the wall efects and its shape corresponds to the cross section shape of the channel. Three views are available to look in details the flow: single bubble side view, rear view and a cut plane along the channel which describes the remeshing methodology of the outer tetrahedron&amp;nbsp;mesh.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;2D simulation of a rising bubble with heat transfer. The bubble, lighter then the surrounding fluid, rises and moves towards the heat interface (green color) . The non-dimensional numbers used in this simulations were Re = 200, Sc = 1000, We = 10, mu_in = 0.5, mu_out = 1.0, rho_out = 1.0, rho_in = 0.01. On the right ha
nd side, the inner and interface meshes are shown. It can be seen that after a certain period of time the bubble does not rise straight, instead the bubble oscillates from one side to another and changes its&amp;nbsp;shape.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Rising of a single bubble immersed in a fluid where the bottom part (red) is heated and has temperature higher then the upper part (blue). The bubble is then release and due to buoyancy effect, it crosses the heat transition line (green color). The heat transfer process takes place into the bubble dynamic and due to th
e bubble rising speed, the heat is advected along with the bubble, thus the two different temperature zones are consequently mixed. The 2D mesh can be seen on the left hand side figure and it comprises many triangles interconnected that need to be rearranged due to the high velocity&amp;nbsp;gradient.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;The interface between fluids is represented by a set of points, edges and facets. These facets are triangles which are part of the tetrahedron mesh. Each triangle represents the shared facet of two adjacent tetrahedrons. As can be seen, while the surface movies with respect to the flow, the elements are compressed spoi
ling the their quality ratios, thus the algorithm should remove excessive concentration of points and remesh locally the hole formed by the deletion&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;The interface between fluids is represented by a set of points, edges and facets. These facets are triangles which are part of the tetrahedron mesh. Each triangle represents the shared facet of two adjacent tetrahedrons. As can be seen, while the surface movies with respect to the flow, the elements are stretched spoil
ing their quality ratios, thus the algorithm should insert points when an edge becomes bigger then a calculated value. Such a value is based on the local curvature and its required&amp;nbsp;precision.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;The rising of a single air bubble in a stagnant column of water has been simulated. The 3-dimensional two-phase flow phenomena can be numerically predicted. At the leftmost frame, the interface between fluid is represented by a set of points, edges and triangular facets which are part of the tetrahedron domain mesh. Th
e middle frame is a contour plot of the same interface and the rightmost one is a side view of the 3-dimensional domain. Due to its properties, the flow field changes the initially spherical shape while the bubble rises, thus affecting all the surrounded&amp;nbsp;fluid.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Numerical simulation of 2D microchannel two-phase flow. The equations are written in the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ALE&lt;/span&gt;) through the Finite Element method (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;FEM&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ANJOS&lt;/span&gt; et al. (2013). The bubble velocity profile is shown on the top of the figure where the highest horizontal speed is represented by the red 
color and the lowest one is represented by the blue color. The mesh used in this simulation is shown in the bottom part of the figure, where the red and blue triangles represent the vapor and liquid phase respectively. Three bubbles are initially distributed along the channel, the last two bubbles coalesce, generating one elongated bubble. This shows a transition regime from slug to elongated bubble&amp;nbsp;flow.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Numerical simulation of 3-dimensional two-phase flow is performed to predict the rising of an air bubble in a initially stagnant water-sugar solution. At the leftmost frame, the interface between fluid is represented by a set of points, edges and triangular facets which are part of the tetrahedron domain mesh. The midd
le frame is a contour plot of the same interface and the rightmost one is a side view of the 3-dimensional domain. Due to the flow nature, the initially spherical shape deforms while in ascension, then later the air bubble converges to its final shape as show in this&amp;nbsp;animation.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
